## Why this blog?

We've poured a lot of time and energy into various projects and interests over the years, but we haven't been the best at writing it all down. So, this blog is our way of capturing the things we are excited about. We will also be working to add some of our older projects as we go!

## What to expect?

Honestly, anything! You can expect a mix of things, from initial ideas and concepts to more fully-formed projects. We tend to create more projects that are on a conceptual level than practical.

## How this blog was built

We put this blog together using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/). Starlight is more geared towards documentation, so we had to tweak it a bit to make it work for a blog. But we think it's shaping up nicely, at least until the next time we get that urge to completely rebuild everything ðŸ™ƒ.

## A note on AI

The use of AI is still a bit of a fuzzy area, both legally and ethically.

Full disclosure: sometimes our writing could use a little help! Thats why we use AI tools, like [Quillbot's Paraphrasing Tool](https://quillbot.com/) among others, to polish what we write and make sure things read smoothly. However, the ideas and the core content are our own.
